# Strobe Lab

This project is a gallery of photos that were captured by using high-speed imaging for a MIT class (6.163) called Strobe Project Laboratory. This is my first time using Mobirise to design a website and do the front end. Unlike Wix, I like that I can quickly design and have control and access to the code of the templates. It can be accelerate the front end work and can be easily integrated with the back end.
